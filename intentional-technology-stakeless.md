      - quote: "The Moai program plants the seed of habit reformation into your mind -- and even if you don't see the results and tall, green stock you're chasing, it's still taking root and subtly encouraging you to keep trying -- and reminding you that it is possible to create change for oneself."

      headline: Follow your Challenge
      content: 
        Every week, you follow a self-set challenge. You then share your insights with your Moai via a 15 minute guided check-in - done on <em>your</em> schedule; due every Sunday.
        <br><br>
        Pay the penalty if you don't submit all your check-ins on time. Honor system!

      headline: Tighten the Feedback Loop
      content: Writing is thinking. The check-ins prompt reflection on what worked and what didn’t. By articulating your learnings, you discover actionable advice for next week. This compounds over time.
    col_2:
      headline: Bias towards Action
      content: Content is deliberately sparse in the program. The emphasis is on execution, not education. Quality content is no longer the bottleneck - the lack of action is.
    col_3:
      headline: Aligned Incentives
      content: We only make money if you succeed. There is no conflict of interest, unlike other business models (e.g ads, endorsements, affiliate links) that are rewarded by consumption, not action.

      headline: FAQs
    faqs:
      - question: Should I pay my penalty if I check in consistently, but fail to reach my goals? 
        answer: Nope. As long as you complete all the check-ins on time, you're good. We believe in self-compassion, understanding and self-love over anything else, including hitting external goals. Sustainable growth and success not only starts with those things, but it requires them.
      - question: What is the time commitment?
        answer: The weekly check-ins only take 15 minutes to complete - you can do them whenever, but they are due every Sunday. That’s it! There are no video calls or live sessions. During the week, you’ll be following your challenge and sharing your progress (optional, but recommended) with your Moai on the Discord group.
      - question: How is this different from a course?
        answer: The program is focused on application, not theory. There will be very limited content and just enough structure for participants to grow at their own pace. It is the best of both worlds - the community of a class paired with the independence of self-learning.
      - question: What if I have questions or sticking points along the way?
        answer: Ask away to your Moai - that’s what they’re there for!
      - question: What is a Moai?
        answer: A Moai is a social support group. The concept originated in Okinawa, Japan - it means "meeting for a common purpose" in Japanese. According to research, they are considered one of the leading factors of the longevity of lifespan of the Okinawan people, making the region among the highest concentration of centenarians in the world.
      - question: I have another question. How do I contact you?
        answer: Shoot us an email at team@themoai.org!
