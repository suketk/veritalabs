          The biggest highlight of the program for me was the feeling that I’ve finally “cracked procrastination” after so many years of struggle. There’s still a long way to go, since I’m dealing with a deeply rooted, very old and tricky habit, but this gives me so much hope. That it is actually possible to defeat it and that I can be in control of my own life and mind, while enjoying the process. Pair that with being more aware of my internal processes through mindfulness and learning about the critical importance of abstinence from vices, and the value that the program provided in four weeks is immeasurable.

          After reading Simon's PDF about the Habit Reframe Method I was hooked on the idea and felt like it would actually help me create a change in my life. Although I really liked the idea I was still overall "lazy" so I was slow to get started. Thankfully, pretty soon after Simon told me about how he would start a small group so we could work on it together and it felt like it was exactly what I needed. After these 4 works, I'm proud to say I've made many improvements, on paper it's not much, but mentally I've grown a lot and I know I'm on the right track now for accomplishing my goals.

          While I entered this program with high expectations of the program - and little faith in my own abilities - I found that the outcome was better than I expected. The program really did work for me, and gave me a great amount of valuable self-knowledge. The success I was able to achieve with the methods taught has given me valuable insight into my own abilities, and useful tools that I continue to use and value.

      headline: Tighten the Feedback Loop
      content: Writing is thinking. The check-ins prompt reflection on what worked and what didn’t. By articulating your learnings, you discover actionable advice for next week. This compounds over time.
    col_2:
      headline: Bias towards Action
      content: The emphasis is on execution - applying the Habit Reframe Method in your daily life to achieve your goals. Your lack of knowledge of the newest self-help trend is not what's holding you back — your lack of action and consistency is.

      headline: Aligned Incentives
      content: We only make money if you succeed. There is no conflict of interest, unlike other business models (e.g ads, endorsements, affiliate links) that are rewarded by consumption, not action.

      headline: FAQs
    faqs:
      - question: Why is a credit card required to register?
        answer: The program is free to join. Your credit card will <strong>not</strong> be charged upon registration. However, we need your card to donate to charity on your behalf <strong>only</strong> if you don't complete the program. This increases your chance of success by 600% and ensures that everyone in your group is serious.
      - question: Will I be charged if I check in consistently, but fail to reach my goals? 
        answer: Nope. As long as you complete all the check-ins on time, you won’t be charged. We believe in self-compassion, understanding and self-love over anything else, including hitting external goals. Sustainable growth and success not only starts with those things, but it requires them.
      - question: What is the time commitment?
        answer: The weekly check-ins only take 15 minutes to complete - you can do them whenever, but they are due every Sunday. That’s it! There are no video calls or live sessions. During the week, you’ll be following your challenge and sharing your progress (optional, but recommended) with your Moai on the Discord group.
      - question: Can I be anonymous?
        answer: Absolutely! There are no video or voice calls. You can also set an anonymous nickname when you join your Moai.
      - question: If I fail, what charity does my stake go to?
        answer: By default, it goes to GiveDirectly. We are not affiliated with them. It's worth noting that we've never actually had to do this - we hope you're not the first! If you have another preference, please email us at team@themoai.org.
      - question: How is this different from a course?
        answer: The program is focused on application — on applying the Habit Reframe Method to your day-to-day life—rather than getting a ton of theory. There will be limited content and just enough structure for participants to grow at their own pace. It is the best of both worlds - the community of a class paired with the independence of self-learning.
      - question: What if I have questions or sticking points along the way?
        answer: Ask away to your Moai - that’s what they’re there for!
      - question: What is a Moai?
        answer: A Moai is a social support group. The concept originated in Okinawa, Japan - it means "meeting for a common purpose" in Japanese. According to research, they are considered one of the leading factors of the longevity of lifespan of the Okinawan people, making the region among the highest concentration of centenarians in the world.
      - question: I have another question. How do I contact you?
        answer: Shoot me an email at simon.dagher@gmail.com!
