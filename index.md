    headline: Intimate community
    content: Students are placed into small cohorts (4 people). This is their “Moai” or social support group. Though the program requires individual work, they're all in it together. They are each other’s source of motivation, accountability and shared learning.

    headline: Weekly challenges
    content: Every week, the Moai is given a challenge and associated self-reflection prompts. It’s ok if a student doesn’t succeed with their challenge, but they must submit their answers to the prompts. If they don’t, their deposit is donated to charity.

    content:
      We run the program so you don’t have to. Besides the first-time setup, there is no ongoing involvement required from you. The group learns from their own experiences and supports each other.

    content:
      Align your incentives with your audience’s - you only succeed if they do. Get paid to make lives better, not to advertise. This revenue stream doesn’t require you to constantly churn out content or stake your reputation on endorsements.

    headline: Differentiate yourself with community.
    content: Content is a commodity now. Lack of quality content isn't the bottleneck to real habit change - the lack of action is. Build a tight-knit community focused on execution, and make that your unique selling point.

      headline: Accountability
      content: Their Moai is a tight-knit cohort that knows each other by name. No more lurking - they’re all in this together. If the others can do the work, they can too.
    col_3:
      headline: Community
      content: The Moai builds off each other through mutual support and shared learnings. Doing the work is an individual journey, but it doesn’t have to feel like one. There’s nothing quite like growing together.

      headline: Aligned Incentives
      content: We only make money if the students succeed. This eliminates the conflict of interest associated with other business models, e.g ads, endorsements, affiliate links.
    col_2:
      headline: Bias towards Action
      content: Content is deliberately sparse in the program. The emphasis is on execution, not education. The lack of content is no longer holding anyone back - it’s the lack of action.
    col_3:
      headline: Tighten the Feedback Loop
      content: Writing is thinking. The weekly questionnaire forces students to reflect on what worked and what didn’t. By precisely articulating their own learnings, they discover immediately actionable advice for the next iteration. This yields compounding results over time.
